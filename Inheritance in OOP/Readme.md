#Introduction
We need Object Oriented Programming concept to deal with the real life entities in our programming world. Now the concept of OOP has a well defined structure of Principles which are:-
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

In this Microbyte we will be learning about the Inheritance

##Pre-requisites
1. Concept of Functions
2. Class and Objects

##Inheritance
Inheritance in OOP works same as in your real life. Let's understand this with a very simple example.
Your parents own properties (like money, home, land, moral values etc) and they eventually gets pass on to you or these are something which you know that you can also use these properties easily. This concept where you can use values or properties of your parents is known as Inheritance.

##Features of Inheritance
1. Minimzes the need to writing duplicate codes.
2. Code gets more organized and in a simpler format
3. Concept of Polymorphism can also be get implemented

##Types of Inheritance:-
1.  Single Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance
3. Multilevel Inheritance
