# Introduction
We need Object Oriented Programming concept to deal with the real life entities in our programming world. Now the concept of OOP has a well defined structure of Principles which are:-
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

In this Microbyte we will be learning about the Inheritance

## Pre-requisites
1. Concept of Functions
2. Class and Objects

## Inheritance
Inheritance in OOP works same as in your real life. Let's understand this with a very simple example.
Your parents own properties (like money, home, land, moral values etc) and they eventually gets pass on to you or these are something which you know that you can also use these properties easily. This concept where you can use values or properties of your parents is known as Inheritance.

## Features of Inheritance
1. Minimzes the need to writing duplicate codes.
2. Code gets more organized and in a simpler format
3. Concept of Polymorphism can also be get implemented

# Types of Inheritance:-
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multiple Inheritance
3. Multilevel Inheritance
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance

## Single Inheritance
In this type of Inheritance, there is only one parent class and only child class which can resuse the properties of the parents class.

Example is depicted in the picture below.

## Multiple Inheritance
In this type of Inheritance, there is a class which inherits a properties of the parent class and then again a child class which inherits the properties of both the parent class.

Note:-
- There can be as much parent class as you want.
- In Java there is no concept of Multiple Inheritance, hence to achieve it we take help of Interfaces

Example is depicted in the picture below.

## Multilevel Inheritance
In this type of Inheritance, there are two or more parent class (isolated from each other) and a child class which can access the properties of both the parent class.

Example is depicted in the picture below.

## Hierarchical Inheritance
In this type of Inheritance, there is one parent class with which multiple child class gets derived and all the child classes are isolated from each other.

Example is depicted in the picture below.

## Hybrid Inheritance
This kind of Inheritance is basically a combination of all the other types of the inheritance.

Note:- Again to acheive it, in Java we will require to use the Interface.

Example is depicted in the picture below.
